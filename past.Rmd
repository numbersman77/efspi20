# Programs, slidedecks, and recordings of past events

If a recording has been made this can be found on the page with the slidedecks.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
past[, "Program"] <- paste("[X](", past[, "Program"], ")", sep = "")
past[, "Slidedecks"] <- paste("[X](", past[, "Slidedecks"], ")", sep = "")
past[is.na(past)] <- ""
kable(past, align = "ccc")
